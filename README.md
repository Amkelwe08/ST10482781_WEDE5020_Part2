# Part 2 README
Overview
I have demonstrated how to implement responsive web design principles by creating a multi-page website for Asipiko Creative Agency.

The website consists of:
Home Page (index.html): This is the homepage of the website which introduces the agency. It has a large hero section and a quick enquiry form.
About Page (about.html): This page has the background of the agency, the agency's values, and its aspirations in a few lines.
Services Page (services.html): This section describes the main services offered which are branding & graphic design, web design & development and digital marketing.
Contact Page (contact.html): This page provides all the contact information for the agency, its location, and how to contact them.
Enquiry Page (enquiry.html): This page contains a simple enquiry form that captures client details and messages.

The project reflects: 
Semantic HTML5-based structure.
CSS3 and styling with the responsive design using media queries aligned to desktop, tablet and mobile.
Navigation that crosses all pages,
Forms that were designed to be usable on both mobile and desktop platforms. 
Design reflective of the brand which integrates the Asipiko theme beautifully; colours, typography, and imagery.
